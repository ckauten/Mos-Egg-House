      <h1 id="welcome">Welcome to Mo's Egg House!</h1>

      <p>
        Mo's Egg House began with a simple dream between Rick and Mo, a husband-and-wife team who have dedicated their
        lives to crafting exceptional breakfast and lunch experiences. Starting their culinary journey in a challenging
        neighborhood in Encino, they moved through various locations, each time building a stronger and more successful
        establishment. From overcoming adversity—including repeated break-ins and personal health battles—to celebrating
        decades of community service, Rick and Mo have consistently brought their personal touch to every aspect of
        their restaurant. Their resilience and passion have transformed Mo's Egg House into a place where every guest is
        treated like family, and every meal is a reminder of home.
